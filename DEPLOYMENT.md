# CI/CD Deployment Guide for Vercel

This guide explains how to set up automatic deployment to Vercel using GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the new Vercel CLI dependency:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Get Vercel Tokens

You'll need to create a Vercel access token and get your project/organization IDs:

1. **Create Vercel Access Token:**
   - Go to [Vercel Account Settings](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
   - Click "Create Token"
   - Give it a name like "GitHub Actions Deploy"
   - Set expiration to "No Expiration" (or your preferred duration)
   - Copy the token value (starts with `vercel_`)

2. **Get Project and Organization IDs:**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Navigate to your project
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **General**
   - Copy the **Project ID** (starts with `prj_`)
   - For Organization ID:
     - If using a team: Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **General** ‚Üí **Team ID** (starts with `team_`)
     - If personal account: Use your Account ID (starts with `user_`)

### 3. Configure GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Add these secrets:

| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | Your Vercel Organization/Account ID | Required for project identification |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | Your Vercel Project ID | Required for project identification |

### 4. Push to GitHub

Once everything is configured, push your changes to the main branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

## üîÑ How the CI/CD Works

### Production Deployment
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
- **Process**: Build ‚Üí Lint ‚Üí Deploy to production
- **URL**: Your production domain

### Preview Deployment
- **Trigger**: Pull requests or pushes to non-main branches
- **Process**: Build ‚Üí Lint ‚Üí Deploy to preview environment
- **URL**: Generated preview URL (shared in PR comments)

## üìã Available Scripts

After setup, you can use these npm scripts locally:

```bash
# Deploy to production
pnpm run deploy

# Deploy to preview
pnpm run deploy:preview

# Type checking
pnpm run type-check

# Build and preview locally
pnpm run build
pnpm run preview
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Defines the GitHub Actions workflow
- Runs on pushes to main/master and pull requests
- Uses pnpm for dependency management
- Deploys to Vercel using the CLI

### `vercel.json`
- Vercel-specific configuration
- Optimized for Next.js deployment
- Includes API route settings and CORS headers
- Set to deploy from Singapore region (sin1)

### `package.json` Updates
- Added Vercel CLI as dev dependency
- Added deployment scripts
- Added type checking script

## üîç Monitoring Deployments

### GitHub Actions
- Check deployment status in **Actions** tab
- View build logs and deployment progress
- See preview URLs in pull request comments

### Vercel Dashboard
- Monitor deployment history
- View real-time logs
- Manage environment variables
- Configure custom domains

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build fails on GitHub Actions**
   - Check that all dependencies are properly listed in `package.json`
   - Ensure Node.js version matches your local setup
   - Verify build scripts work locally

2. **Vercel deployment fails**
   - Check that `VERCEL_TOKEN` is valid and not expired
   - Verify `VERCEL_ORG_ID` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` are correct
   - Ensure project has proper permissions

3. **Preview deployments not working**
   - Check branch protection rules
   - Verify workflow triggers are set correctly
   - Ensure pull request events are enabled

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check Vercel CLI status
pnpm dlx vercel --help

# List your Vercel projects
pnpm dlx vercel projects list

# Check deployment status locally
pnpm dlx vercel ls
```
